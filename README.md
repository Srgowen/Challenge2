Challenge2
this is my portfolio website with a link to a youtube video i made for a wazuh/opensense cyber security lab as well as interactive tabs for my intro and contact information that i made with a simple java script code. Most everything is made with CSS using flex box and various properties to allow for buttons and tabs to change colors on click and on hover. a picture of the website can be found under project2a/websitePicturePortfolio.jpg
